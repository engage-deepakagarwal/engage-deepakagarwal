### 🧠 About Me
- _"AI without business impact is just interesting code."_ This philosophy guides my approach as a thought leader and hands-on seasoned Cloud Solutions and AI Architect in building systems that deliver quantifiable outcomes.
- Architecting solutions that have moved the needle in building next-gen contract intelligence domain.
- Thinks from first principles, translate complex concepts into business value, and lead cross-functional teams to exceed customer expectations.
- My expertise spans the full AI implementation lifecycle - from strategic vision to hands-on development and production deployment.

### 🏆 Selected AI Achievements (so far)
- Spearheaded the development of autonomous contract-redlining using AI agents (AutoGen, 
LangChain, Azure OpenAI), mentoring a team of interns to expedite project delivery.
- Ideated and delivered “Intent-2-Prompt” using Agentic AI cutting manual prompt-refinement 
efforts by ~80% while boosting accuracy by ~70%.
- Pioneered the strategic vision and architected AI-Powered Icertis Custom Agent integrated with Microsoft 
Copilot using the next-gen extensibility framework, collaborating closely with Microsoft
stakeholders. Now part of [Teams App Store](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA200006824?tab=Overview) with citations in [Microsoft Build](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/microsoft-build-2025-how-to-create-a-%E2%80%9Cfrontier%E2%80%9D-workplace-powered-by-agents/4414287) blogs.
- Engineered a high-throughput data ingestion pipeline for multi-lingual agreements of different
file types (OCR, language translation, embeddings generation, attribute/clauses/summary
extraction) at a rate of ~1K documents/hour, meeting stringent non-functional requirements.
- Led Generative AI adoption for the [Icertis Copilot](https://www.icertis.com/products/platform/copilot/) partnering with product managers and data 
scientists to implement advanced AI features for ST/MT customers (including regulated US GOV 
customers) with custom APIM load-balancing policies on Azure OpenAI.
